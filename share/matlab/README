 In order to use these matlab scripts they must be in the search path
 matlab uses for finding script files. There are two ways to alter this
 path:

 1) To temporarily augment the path in a single matlab session simply do
    a

    > path( path, '<path_to_CFS++_sandbox>/auxiliary/matlab' );

 2) To permanently augment the path for each matlab session you must define
    the MATLABPATH environment variable accordingly. In the tcsh this is
    e.g. done by setting

    a) if ( -x /home/shareAll/linux_bin/bin/matlab ) then
    b)   alias matlab 'matlab -nodesktop -nosplash'
    c)   setenv MATLABPATH <path_to_CFS++_sandbox>/auxiliary/matlab
    d) endif
